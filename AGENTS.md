# fe-harness Agent Guide

This repository contains a business-agnostic frontend engineering and quality harness.

## Read order

1. Read this file.
2. Read `.fe-harness/project.yaml`.
3. Read `docs/PROJECT_MAP.md` before locating modules or assessing impact.
4. Read `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` before changing package boundaries or configuration protocols.
5. Read `docs/CURRENT_STATUS.md` before continuing implementation.
6. Read `docs/ROADMAP.md` before expanding supported profiles, platforms, or stacks.

## Scope

- Keep Core independent from product type, platform, framework, and business domain.
- Put product-shape rules in `profiles/`.
- Put runtime-platform rules in `platforms/`.
- Put framework and toolchain rules in `stacks/`.
- Keep project-owned values in `.fe-harness/project.yaml`.
- Do not introduce business pages, domain statuses, API endpoints, brands, or token values.

## Change boundaries

Obtain confirmation before:

- Adding or upgrading production dependencies.
- Changing the public configuration schema or CLI interface.
- Replacing the package manager, test runner, or repository structure.
- Publishing packages, creating remotes, pushing tags, or changing release automation.
- Adding a new product profile, platform adapter, or stack adapter beyond the active roadmap stage.

## Development flow

1. Restate the requested outcome.
2. Identify affected Core, CLI, Profile, Platform, Stack, template, schema, and test files.
3. Preserve backward compatibility unless a breaking change is explicitly approved.
4. Add or update focused tests.
5. Run:
   - `pnpm test`
   - `node packages/cli/bin/fe-harness.mjs version`
   - Example Doctor or verification when relevant.
6. Report actual verification results, remaining limitations, and whether confirmation boundaries were touched.

Do not automatically commit, push, publish, or initialize external services unless explicitly requested.
